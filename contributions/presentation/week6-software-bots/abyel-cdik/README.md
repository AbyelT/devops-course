## Description
Merging can be a time consuming task in big projects with many branches and pull requests. Handing each PR means assinging 
reviewers, approving, adding comments and merging. On certain cases the main branch may be updated, making the pull request updated
and thus it must be rebased. 

Mergify is a pull request automation tool that solves these issues, trhough actions that are triggered based on the 
pull requests. In this presentation we intend to describe how mergify is configured, how to specify actions with _rules_ and 
how Mergify can queue merging of pull requests in a sequential order.
